# SliCR-3D

**SliCR-3D** is a fork of SuperSlicer and PrusaSlicer, which are both forks of Slic3r. Previously known as Slic3r++.

Prebuilt Windows, Linux, and macOS 64-bit releases are available through the [git releases page](https://github.com/CR-3D/SliCR-3D/releases). Linux & macOS builds are compiled but not extensively tested, so please report any bugs. For installation, check the badges above. Windows users can use chocolatey or scoop. Nightly builds are available through the [git actions page](https://github.com/CR-3D/SliCR-3D/actions). Click on the build for your platform and then on the archive name (`nightly_win64` or `SliCR-3D-gtk2.AppImage` or `nightly_macos.dmg`) in the "Artifacts" section in the top right corner.

**SliCR-3D** takes 3D models (STL, OBJ, AMF) and converts them into G-code instructions for FFF printers or PNG layers for mSLA 3D printers. It's compatible with any modern printer based on the RepRap toolchain using firmware such as Marlin, Prusa, Klipper, etc.

**SliCR-3D** is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research and [SuperSlicer](https://github.com/supermerill/SuperSlicer) by supermerill, which are both based on [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.

For detailed compilation instructions, refer to the [wiki](https://github.com/CR-3D/SliCR-3D/wiki) and the [documentation directory](doc/).
